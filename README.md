# coderetreat-pocketmod 

Inspired by Julia Evans [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com/) and [pocketmod](https://pocketmod.com/).

A leaflet/foldlet/booklet to give to people at a [coderetreat](https://coderetreat.org) or for spreading the word.

Download [booklet](coderetreat-pocketmod-booklet.pdf).

Printing : Print near to 100% scale instead of 'fit to page', some printers have smaller printable areas, so you need to adjust the scale maybe down to 98%.

For folding instructions see [how to](https://pocketmod.com/howto).

Many thanks to the community around [coderetreat](https://coderetreat.org).

Used [pdfjam-pocketmod](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/software/pdfjam/) to create out of 8 page pdf the booklet.
